Python Patchwork Maker

This project generates customizable patchworks of geometric patterns based on user inputs. The program uses Python’s graphics library to draw 5×5, 7×7, or 9×9 patchworks, with designs and colors determined by the user and student-specific details. It includes robust input validation and an interactive mode where users can select and edit patches using their mouse and keyboard.
